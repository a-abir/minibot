Hardware Prerequisites
======================
*Setup Raspberry PI for development*

Powering Servos / PWM
**********************

*To power servos you will need to also connect the 5-6V V+ power supply*
- this is the power supply for the servos

*You can use a portable 4 or 5 x AA battery pack can be connected to the terminal block*

*Or you can connect this power through the terminal block or the 2.1mm DC jack*

Current Draw Requirements
*************************

*Nearly all servos are designed to run on about 5 or 6v. Keep in mind that a lot of servos moving at the same time (particularly large powerful ones) will need a lot of current. Even micro servos will draw several hundred mA when moving. Some High-torque servos will draw more than 1A each under load*

Connecting a Servo
******************

*Most servos come with a standard 3-pin female connector that will plug directly into the headers on the Servo HAT headers. Be sure to align the plug with the ground wire (usually black or brown) with the bottom row and the signal wire (usually yellow or white) on the top*

*Works with any servo that can be powered by 5V and take 3.3V logic level signals*
